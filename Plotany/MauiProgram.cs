             * Use of ArcGIS location services, including basemaps and geocoding, requires either:
             * 1) User authentication: Automatically generates a unique, short-lived access token when a user signs in to your application with their ArcGIS account
             *    giving your application permission to access the content and location services authorized to an existing ArcGIS user's account.
             *    You'll get an identity by signing into the ArcGIS Portal.
             * 2) API key authentication: Uses a long-lived access token to authenticate requests to location services and private content.
             *    Go to https://links.esri.com/create-an-api-key to learn how to create and manage an API key using API key credentials, and then call 
             *    .UseApiKey("[Your ArcGIS location services API Key]")
             *    in the UseArcGISRuntime call below. */

             * You can set the license string by calling .UseLicense(licenseString) in the UseArcGISRuntime call below
